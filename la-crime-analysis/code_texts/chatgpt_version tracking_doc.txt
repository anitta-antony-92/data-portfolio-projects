You set the environment variable for Google Cloud credentials and initialized the BigQuery client to fetch the dataset.
BigQuery Data Extraction:

You retrieved a dataset from Google BigQuery using SQL (crime_data table) and loaded it into a pandas DataFrame.
Data Preprocessing:

Removed unnecessary columns: dr_no, date_occ, and date_rptd.
Dropped duplicates from the dataset.
Applied frequency encoding to high-cardinality columns: mocodes, location, cross_street.
Applied label encoding to low-cardinality columns: premis_desc, weapon_desc.
Performed one-hot encoding for categorical columns: area_name, vict_descent, status_desc.
Applied label encoding to categorical columns: crm_cd_desc, vict_sex, status.
Removed non-numeric columns from the DataFrame.
Feature and Target Definition:

Defined X (features) and y (target) for training.
Split data into training and test sets.
Data Imputation and Feature Engineering:

Applied manual feature engineering for missing values and filling in gaps in the training data (crm_cd_1, crm_cd_2, crm_cd_3, crm_cd_4, and vict_age).
Model Training (Logistic Regression):

Initialized the LogisticRegression model with max_iter=1000 and verbosity set to 1.
The training process was executed (though model training was commented out in the first version).
Time Measurement:

Measured and printed the time taken to train the model using the time module.
Next Steps for Change Tracking:
As you share updated versions of your script, I'll help you track the following types of changes:

Data Processing Adjustments: Changes in preprocessing steps such as different encoding methods, handling missing values, or feature engineering.
Modeling Changes: If you decide to switch models (e.g., RandomForest, XGBoost), adjust hyperparameters, or change the model's settings.
Evaluation Metrics: If you modify how model performance is measured or add more metrics.
Performance Optimization: If you're trying to optimize for larger datasets, I'll look for changes related to scaling, parallel processing, or memory management.
Data Handling for Big Data: Any approach to handling large datasets more efficiently (e.g., batch processing, data chunking).
Please share the next version of your script when you're ready, and I will provide detailed change tracking based on the modifications.

Change Tracker: Version 2 of Your Script
Here is a detailed breakdown of the changes introduced in Version 2 compared to the first version of your script:

1. System Monitoring Integration:
New Imports:

Added the psutil library for monitoring system resources such as CPU, memory, and disk usage.
Introduced time for tracking execution time.
New Function:

Added monitor_system_health() to check and print the system's health (CPU, memory, and disk usage) at various stages of the script execution.
2. BigQuery Query Modification:
Limited Rows:
The dataset query now includes LIMIT 50000, restricting the number of rows pulled to 50,000 to prevent memory overload, which is a crucial change for handling large datasets.
3. Preprocessing Enhancements:
High-Cardinality Encoding:

Refined frequency encoding for high-cardinality columns (mocodes, location, cross_street).
After encoding, the original columns are dropped (via df = df.drop(columns=[col])), reducing memory usage.
Label Encoding:

Enhanced label encoding for low-cardinality columns (vict_sex, premis_desc, weapon_desc, status) with a conditional check to ensure columns are present before encoding.
Original columns are dropped after encoding.
One-Hot Encoding:

One-hot encoding applied to categorical columns (area_name, vict_descent, status_desc) with drop_first=True to avoid multicollinearity.
4. Memory Optimization:
Optimizing Column Types:

The vict_age column is converted to numeric and missing values are imputed with the median (fillna(df['vict_age'].median())).
The crm_cd_desc column is cast to category type, optimizing memory usage for categorical data.
Preprocessing Memory Usage Check:

Added memory usage print statements before and after preprocessing to track the impact of changes on memory usage.
5. Handling Missing Values:
Target Variable (y):
Missing values in the target (y) are filled with the mode (most frequent value) to avoid errors during model training.
Feature Variables (X):
Added missing value imputation using SimpleImputer (median strategy) for the feature variables (X) instead of just dropping rows with missing values.
6. Model Training and Evaluation:
Logistic Regression:

The script trains a Logistic Regression model with max_iter=1000 and solver='liblinear'. The model's training time is measured, and accuracy is calculated and printed.
Random Forest (commented out):

A Random Forest model (RandomForestClassifier) is also set up but commented out. If enabled, this model would be trained and evaluated as an alternative to Logistic Regression.
7. Total Runtime Measurement:
Added tracking of the total runtime of the entire script by measuring the time from the start to the end of the execution.
8. Monitoring System Health at Key Steps:
Health Monitoring:
The system's CPU, memory, and disk usage are monitored before and after key stages in the script:
Before and after loading the data from BigQuery.
After preprocessing steps.
Before and after model training.
After model evaluation.
Summary of Key Changes:
System Monitoring: Added psutil for system health monitoring.
Dataset Handling: Limited data pulled from BigQuery to 50,000 rows.
Efficient Preprocessing:
Used encoding and imputation to optimize memory usage.
Dropped original columns after encoding.
Handling Missing Values: Applied imputation to both target (y) and features (X).
Modeling Adjustments: Introduced LogisticRegression and included an optional RandomForestClassifier.
Runtime Tracking: Added tracking for the total runtime of the script.
If you're ready to share the next version, I will continue to track these changes in detail.

Change Tracker: Version 3 of Your Script
Here’s a detailed breakdown of the changes in Version 3 compared to Version 2 of your script:

1. New Libraries Added:
Imports:
StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing: For feature scaling (normalizing the data).
VarianceThreshold from sklearn.feature_selection: For removing constant features with zero variance.
PCA from sklearn.decomposition: For dimensionality reduction to reduce the number of features.
2. Data Preprocessing Enhancements:
Variance Threshold (Feature Selection):

Introduced VarianceThreshold to remove features with constant values (zero variance). This helps eliminate redundant features from the dataset that do not contribute to the model.
Applied this filter on X before feature scaling.
Feature Scaling:

Added StandardScaler to standardize the features by scaling them to zero mean and unit variance. This is particularly useful for algorithms that are sensitive to feature scaling.
Dimensionality Reduction:

Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of features in X to 20 components. PCA is a technique used for dimensionality reduction by transforming features into orthogonal components that explain the variance in the data.
3. Encoding Adjustments:
LabelEncoder for Target (y):
LabelEncoder is now fit on the entire target (y) column before training the model. This ensures that all possible classes are captured.
After encoding, both y_train and y_test are transformed using the fitted encoder.
During prediction, the labels are decoded back to their original class names using inverse_transform.
4. Random Forest Model:
Model:
The script now trains a RandomForestClassifier with n_estimators=100, random_state=42, and n_jobs=-1 for parallel processing (using all available CPU cores).
The training time for Random Forest is now tracked.
Prediction and Evaluation:
After fitting the model, predictions are made on the test set (X_test), and the model's accuracy is evaluated.
The classification report is printed using classification_report, which provides detailed metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, in addition to accuracy.
5. System Health Monitoring:
System Health Checks:
System health is now monitored more frequently during key stages of the script, especially before and after preprocessing and model training.
6. Print Class Distribution:
Before training the model, the distribution of classes in y_train and y_test is printed. This helps understand the balance of the target variable and check if class imbalances exist, which could impact the model's performance.
7. Improved Memory and Execution Time Reporting:
After feature selection, scaling, and PCA, the memory usage is printed again to monitor the impact of these transformations on the dataset size.
The total runtime of the entire script is tracked and printed at the end.
Summary of Key Changes:
Feature Selection:

Applied VarianceThreshold to remove constant features.
Feature Scaling:

Introduced StandardScaler to normalize features.
Dimensionality Reduction:

Applied PCA to reduce the dataset to 20 components.
Label Encoding:

Fit the LabelEncoder on the entire target column (y), and transformed both y_train and y_test accordingly.
Added decoding step for predicted labels.
Random Forest Model:

Trained a RandomForestClassifier and evaluated it using accuracy and classification report.
Class Distribution Reporting:

Printed the class distribution for y_train and y_test before model training.
System Health Monitoring:

More frequent checks on system health before and after major steps (e.g., data loading, preprocessing, and model training).
If you're ready to share the next version, I will continue tracking these modifications in detail.
