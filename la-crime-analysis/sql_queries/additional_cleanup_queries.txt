Steps to Check for Additional Cleanup Needs

Check for Missing Values:
Verify if there are any missing values in critical columns (e.g., crm_cd, date_occ, area).

Check for Duplicates:
Ensure there are no duplicate rows in the dataset.

Check for Inconsistencies:
Look for inconsistencies in categorical columns (e.g., different spellings of the same category).

Check Data Types:
Ensure columns have the correct data types (e.g., timestamps are in TIMESTAMP format, numerical columns are in INT64 or FLOAT64).

Check for Outliers:
Identify outliers in numerical columns (e.g., vict_age).

SQL Queries to Check for Data Issues

1. Check for Missing Values - Fill Missing Values
If there are missing values in important columns, fill them with a default value:

SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
  COUNTIF(crm_cd IS NULL) AS missing_crm_cd,
  COUNTIF(time_occ IS NULL) AS missing_timestamp,
  COUNTIF(area IS NULL) AS missing_area
FROM
  `la-crime-analysis.la_crime_dataset.crime_data`;

2. Check for Duplicates
Remove duplicate rows based on a unique identifier or combination of columns:

SELECT
  *,
  COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM
  `la-crime-analysis.la_crime_dataset.crime_data`
GROUP BY
  crm_cd, date_occ, area, vict_age, weapon_used_cd
HAVING
  COUNT(*) > 1;

3. Check for Inconsistencies in Categorical Columns
For example, check for inconsistent values in crm_cd:


4. Check Data Types
You can inspect the schema of the table to ensure data types are correct:
If a column (e.g., date_occ) is stored as a string, convert it to a timestamp:


SELECT
  column_name,
  data_type
FROM
  `la-crime-analysis.la_crime_dataset.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`
WHERE
  table_name = 'crime_data';

5. Check for Outliers in Numerical Columns
For example, check for outliers in vict_age: Cap vict_age at a reasonable value (e.g., 100):


SELECT
  MIN(vict_age) AS min_age,
  MAX(vict_age) AS max_age,
  AVG(vict_age) AS avg_age
FROM
  `la-crime-analysis.la_crime_dataset.crime_data`;
  
6. Standardize Categorical Columns
Convert column_name to lowercase for consistency:

Best Practices for Cleanup
Backup Your Data:

Before making any changes, create a backup of your table:

CREATE TABLE `la-crime-analysis.la_crime_dataset.crime_data_backup` AS
SELECT * FROM `la-crime-analysis.la_crime_dataset.crime_data`;
